            <h2>Have You Found an Orphaned or Injured Wild Animal?</h2>
            <p>In this situation, you need to locate the closest state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator near you who works with the species.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Personally, I rehabilitate New York-native predator-type mammals (foxes, minks, weasels). However, I cannot always intake an animal, as I am a one-man show with wildlife rehab, and I have capacity capacity limitations.</p>

            <h2>Animal Help Now Website</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.ahnow.org" class="ahn">Animal Help Now (AHN) website</a> has been a GREAT resource for help connect the public and rehabbers. I really like this tool, as it tends to have the most up-to-date information of any wildlife help search engine I know of.</p>
            <h3>How the AHN Site Works:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Type in your address.</li>
                <li> It will populate a list of rehabbers based on that location.</li>
                <li> The search results will state which species each rehabber works with.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Note:</b> It is important that not all wildlife rehabilitators work with-or are licensed for-all native species.</p>

        <section class="care-instructions">
            <h2>Temporary Care Instructions</h2>
            <p>In the meantime, if safely possible, keep the animal contained in a quiet, dark area with minimal stimulation and human/pet traffic. Do not handle it. Avoid attempting to feed the animal until it gets to a rehabber, as it can sometimes do more harm than good if the animal is not yet stabilized and hydrated.</p>

            <h2>Do You Need Help with a Captive-Bred Exotic?</h2>
            <p>Need placement for a captive-born fox, wolfdog, or other exotic pet or rescue? These animals must stay in captivity, as it is both illegal and immoral to release a captive-bred wild animal. Please feel free to send me a detailed email if you need assistance with the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Species</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Vet history (if any)</li>
                <li>Temperament</li>
                <li>Important details or quirks</li>
                <li>Photos of the animal</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Depending on the species and my capacity, I cannot guarantee that I can intake your animal.</p>

        <section class="wolfdog-placement">
            <h2>Wolfdog/Wolf Hybrid Placement</h2>
            <p>Many wolfdog sanctuaries are always at full capacity. I strongly suggest posting on wolfdog rehoming groups on Facebook. Request to join these groups before posting. If a facility or qualified home is looking for a specific temperament, gender, content %, etc., they will be watching these group postings. Use your discretion when vetting potential homes.</p>
